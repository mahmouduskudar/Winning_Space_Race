# Winning Space Race With Data Science
Applied Data Science Capstone (IBM)

	Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars;
 	other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.
	Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
	This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SPACE-X for a rocket launch.
	In this lab, I will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.
